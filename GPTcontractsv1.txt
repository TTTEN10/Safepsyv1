/// This NFT contract has a few key features:

It has a bytes32 public variable assetId that represents the identifier of the asset that this NFT represents.

It has an address public variable owner that represents the address of the owner of this NFT.

It has a constructor function that sets the initial values of the NFT. This function takes in a bytes32 argument _assetId, which is used to set the value of the assetId variable.

It has a transfer function that allows the owner to transfer the ownership of this NFT to another address. This function takes in an address argument _to, which is used to set the value of the owner variable.

/// In this modified version of the NFT contract, we added a new address[] public variable allowedAddresses that represents the list of addresses that are allowed to transfer this NFT.

We also added a new constructor function that takes in an additional address[] argument _allowedAddresses, which is used to set the value of the allowedAddresses variable.

Finally, we added a new isAddressAllowed helper function that checks if an address is on the allowed list. This function is called in the transfer function to ensure that the address you are trying to transfer the NFT to is on the allowed list.
